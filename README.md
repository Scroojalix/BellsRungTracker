# BellsRungTracker
Simple plugin that tracks the number of bells a player has rung.
This is just a simple recreation of the plugin used in Wilbur Soot's YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWAd4oJp40Y) titled "I Forced 100 Players to Compete in a Bell-Ringing Contest"
All credits go to him for the idea. I just thought it would be a fun little project to rebuild the plugin.
